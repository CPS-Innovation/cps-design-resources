## Where is it from  

This pattern is based on the [GOV.UK card](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/summary-list/) component. It has been adapted for screens where multiple items are displayed on a single page.  

## When to use this pattern  

Use this pattern when a page contains multiple form fields, and the standard "Check your answers" pattern does not provide an intuitive way for users to navigate back to specific items.  

## When not to use this pattern  

Only use this pattern if usability testing indicates that the standard GDS "Check your answers" pattern is ineffective due to the presence of multiple items per page.  

## Usage  

This pattern is currently used in:  
- Housekeeping
