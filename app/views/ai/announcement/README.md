## Where

Before the start of a flow or task

## Mindful friction could help

- Communicate tool’s benefits
- Clarify user’s and organisational responsibilities
- Flag important limitations of the tool

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Excessive caution against automation
- Shifts in real and perceived responsibility
- Internal concerns about automation’s effects on others

## Don’ts

- Don’t use this pattern more frequently than strictly necessary, as users will start to ignore it
- Include too much content: use progressive disclosure or link to content pages for more in-depth information


## Needs testing

- What content to include in each context
- What’s an appropriate frequency of use which won’t trigger “banner blindness”
