Used when AI features could be helpful, but there is a risk they might get in the way of existing workflows and needs

## Where

At the start of a task, before the AI outputs have been generated

## Mindful friction could help

- Give the user agency over their workflow
- Get implicit feedback on the perception of the usefulness of AI features

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Loss of job satisfaction
- Loss of creativity

## Don’ts

- Use it every time AI outputs are possible — consider where it makes sense for preserving user’s autonomy


## Needs testing

- Which parts of the process require more individual autonomy in the use of AI outputs
- What’s the best format for this pattern, eg. a question, a button, a separate tab that has to be navigated to, etc
