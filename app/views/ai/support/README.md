## Where

Before the start of a flow or task

## Mindful friction could help

- Create a reflection point to review own processes, without interrupting a task in progress
- Invite discovery of how tools can be used for skill development

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Unjust or unfair outcomes and processes
- Increased cognitive load leading to mistakes

## Don’ts

- Don’t use this pattern more frequently than strictly necessary, as users will start to ignore it
- Make it sound patronising or threatening
- Rely on AI recommendations for staff performance assessments


## Needs testing

- What’s the right way to bring up opportunities for improvement
- Which skills can be developed using AI tools
- What’s an appropriate frequency for offering self-development tips
- How to develop this pattern with staff and unions, as one of the risks could be an increased worry about workplace surveillance
