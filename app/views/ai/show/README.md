Used when it’s important to understand whether the content was created by a person or was AI-generated, for example during review

<div><img src="/public/images/cps/showAuthor1.png" alt="Example show authorship summary " style="width:100%;height:auto"></div>
<div><img src="/public/images/cps/showAuthor2.png" alt="Example from the letter drafter use case" style="width:100%;height:auto"></div>

## Where

Once the task has been completed, AI outputs have become part of the work

## Mindful friction could help

- Provide transparency about which parts were AI generated

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- More difficult to correct errors

## Don’ts

- Overuse this pattern, include it only where it adds relevant information, as it can increase cognitive load


## Needs testing

- What context would be enhanced by the availability of this pattern, eg. when reviewing one’s own or someone else’s work
