## Where

In the context of a task where the outputs are shown

## Mindful friction could help

- Create a moment of consideration about what is being presented
- Explain why the outputs are being presented
- Provide a mechanism to report issues with AI outputs

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Automation complacency
- Unjust or unfair outcomes or processes

## Donâ€™ts

- Overload the pattern with content, it needs to be easily skimmed


## Needs testing

- Which types of AI-generated outputs require a summary explanation in context
- How to summarise AI outputs
- What the reporting process should look like, and how it feeds into processes for governance and improving the AI tools
