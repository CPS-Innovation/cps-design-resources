Used when presenting an AI feature to the user for the very first time, or when there’s a higher risk associated with the use of AI

## Where

At the start of a flow or task

## Mindful friction could help

- Explain what the tool does
- Explain what is being monitored and why
- Clarify user’s and organisational responsibilities
- Flag important limitations of the tool
- Flag increased risk if used in high risk scenarios

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Excessive caution against automation
- Shifts in real and perceived responsibility
- Internal concerns about automation’s effects on others

## Don’ts

- Don’t use this pattern more frequently than strictly necessary, as users will start to ignore it
- Include too much content: use progressive disclosure or link to content pages for more in-depth information
- Use this pattern if you’re going to use other high friction
patterns in the same flow


## Needs testing

- What content to include in each context
- What’s an appropriate frequency of use which won’t trigger “banner blindness”
