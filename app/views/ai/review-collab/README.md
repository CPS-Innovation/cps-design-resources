## Where

Once the task has been completed, AI outputs have become part of the work

## Mindful friction could help

- Provide a moment of pause to check the work against predefined criteria

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Shifts in real or perceived responsibility
- Automation complacency

## Donâ€™ts

- Use this pattern too late into the process, it needs to be easy to make changes
- Use it for every type of collaborative output, only when the work carries a degree of risk


## Needs testing

- Which types of tasks would benefit from this pattern, eg. when outputs will be used for decision making, or will be public-facing
