Used when it’s important to remind the user they are taking responsibility for the work they’re submitting, including AI-generated outputs

## Where

At the end of a task, AI outputs are part of the work

## Mindful friction could help

- Provide a moment of pause and an opportunity to review work
- Remind the user about theirs and organisational responsibilities

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Automation complacency
- Shifts in real or perceived responsibility

## Don’ts

- Use this pattern unless there’s good reason to, eg. high risk of something going wrong, as users will become used to it and ignore it over time
- Use this pattern when you’ve already used other high friction patterns in the current flow


## Needs testing

- In which contexts using this pattern makes sense
- What are the responsibilities users take in those contexts
