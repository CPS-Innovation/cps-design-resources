Used when many generated outputs could be correct, but the best choice is a matter of judgement

## Where

During a task, once the AI outputs have been generated

## Mindful friction could help

- Review the right tone or approach
- Check with the user what’s relevant and what isn’t
- Reject incorrect outputs
- Provide implicit feedback on AI-generated outputs and an explicit way to report issues

## Risks this pattern could mitigate

- Automation complacency
- Skills fade
- Failure of AI to handle factual info correctly

## Don’ts

- Use content chunks that are very long, because they will be harder to compare at a glance


## Needs testing

- The best way to present outputs for an effective comparison
- How best to split outputs into sections that make sense thematically
- Whether to include any other information alongside the generated output, the goal of each section, what must be included in the copy, etc
