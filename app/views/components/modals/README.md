## Where is it from

This is a CPS created pattern


## When to use this component

Use modals sparingly, start with a full page by default.

Modals can be appropriate when:
- the user is working within a layout that has fixed side navigation, and they’re selecting something that adds a sub-step (Lydia to add a screengrab)
- you don’t want the user to lose progress or context on the current page,for example if filters are set or the page would take a long time to reload
- you’re allowing the user to update a single attribute on a long page, and it doesn’t make sense to navigate away, for example editing a status or label (but not something more complex like adding a new witness with multiple fields)



## When not to use this component

- do not use a modal when you could have used a page
