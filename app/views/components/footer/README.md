The footer sits at the bottom of each page on the service.

<div><img src="/public/images/cps/footer-1.png" alt="image of the action button open showing the options available" style="width:100%;height:auto"></div>

## Where is it from

[DWP design system](https://design-system.dwp.gov.uk/components/internal-service-footer) 
We currently only use the footer with links, we do not currently use the footer with secondary navigation.

## When to use this component
Use this footer for internal services not hosted on service.gov.uk domains. Users of these services will normally be CPS staff.

## When not to use this component

If your service is hosted on a service.gov.uk domain it should use the GOV.UK Design System footer component.

## How it works

Like the GOV.UK footer, the internal service footer can be adapted to the needs of your service. When deciding what information to place in the footer, remember that:

- information placed in the footer is sometimes skipped or not noticed
- the grey background lowers the contrast ratio which will limit readability for some people
As a minimum the footer should include links to your serviceâ€™s accessibility statement and privacy notice. 


## Where is it used

A variant of this component is currently used in:
- casework app
