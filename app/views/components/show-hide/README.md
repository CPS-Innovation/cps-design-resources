## When to use this component

Use this component when displaying elements in a table and additional details are needed for a specific row. The standard terminology is show/hide, but variations like preview/hide may be used depending on the user’s action.

## When not to use this component

Avoid using this component simply to add more information to a row without assessing its necessity. Ensure that only the details essential for the user to take their next action are displayed. 

## How it works

At the end of a table row, the user will see a “show” option. Selecting it expands the row to reveal additional information. Choosing “hide” will collapse the expanded content.
