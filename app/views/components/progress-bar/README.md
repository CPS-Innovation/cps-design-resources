## When to use this component

Consider using the GOV.UK [Complete multiple tasks](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/patterns/complete-multiple-tasks/) first. If the multiple tasks is not suitable then consider using this pattern, however discuss with the design team and design lead first.

The component is useful when users need the flexibility to complete their tasks in a non-sequential order or switch between different tasks as needed.

## When not to use this component

Progress bars are not used to show individual steps within a transaction, or used as a navigation. It should only be used for non-sequential order transactions. 

## How it works

The user can navigate through the transaction in any order, moving back and forth between completed sections. A tick will appear in the roundel to indicate completed sections.
