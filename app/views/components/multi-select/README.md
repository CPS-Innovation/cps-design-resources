## Action buttons
 
- Keep action buttons close to the checkboxes so itâ€™s obvious they belong together
- Do not 'grey out' action buttons 
- If the page is paginated put the actions at top and bottom of the page
- If the page is a long list then you can make the actions at the top sticky, so that they are easily availble when the page is scrolled
