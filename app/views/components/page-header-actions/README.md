Use the page header actions component for certain actions.

<div><img src="/public/images/cps/page-header-1.png" alt="image of the multiselct being used on housekeeping" style="width:100%;height:auto"></div>

## Where is it from

We use the [MOJ Design System](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/components/page-header-actions/) pattern.

## When to use this component

Use this when:

- the content of the page is so long that users have to scroll past it to see actions. For example, having a “Create case” button underneath a long list of cases.
- the action is applied to the page item and not one specific part of the content. For example, in a user profile page, it could make sense to put the “Suspend user” action in the header.

## When not to use this component

Don’t place buttons next to the header when they are specific to a component within the page.

## How to use

The component ensures the buttons are aligned right in line with the heading. On small screens the buttons tuck underneath the heading.
