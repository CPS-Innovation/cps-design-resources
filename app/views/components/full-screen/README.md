## Where is it from

This is a custom control created for the casework app. 

## When to use this component
The control is used to give more space in the viewport to documents or core information a user is interacting with. 

## When not to use this component

If the user needs more space for the core document or work area on the screen consider redesigning the screens to show less information.

Hovering over the full screen button:
- displays the tooltip with the text "View full screen"

Clicking the full screen button:
- Collapses the columns next to the main document viewer
- Expands the main document viewer to full width of the screen
- Creates a new button at the edge of the main document viewer to "Exit full screen"

Hovering over the exit screen button:

Clicking the exit screen button:
- Expands the columns next to the main document viewer to their default width
