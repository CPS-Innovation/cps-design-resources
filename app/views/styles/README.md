# Styles

Make your service look and feel like CPS.

We use patterns from existing design systems in this order:

[CPS Outsystems Style Guide](https://cps-dev.outsystemsenterprise.com/Casework_StyleGuide/UIPatterns)
CPS Design System for design patterns - This pattern library for patterns that are not yet in the Outsystems style guide
[GDS Design System](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/)
[Ministry of Justice Design System](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/)
[Home Office Design System](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/)
[Full list of Gov design systems and services](https://x-govuk.github.io//)


If you are using [Ministry of Justice Frontend](https://design-patterns.service.justice.gov.uk/) in your build or prototype, the MOJ coded examples in the MOJ Design System won’t need any additional styling.

If you are using [Home Office Frontend](https://design.homeoffice.gov.uk/get-started) in your build or prototype, the Home Office coded examples in the Home Office Design System won’t need any additional styling.

If you need to apply styles manually, you should still follow existing CPS conventions. For example, don’t assign new meanings to colours, don’t change the style of buttons or adjust the thickness of borders on form inputs.


# Fonts

CPS has licenced the font [NewTransport](http://www.newtransport.co.uk/). It is the font that the GDS Transport font is based on. It is very similar to the original GDS font, when used it tends to take up slightly more horizontal space than the GDS font but is close enough that it is hard to distinguish between the two.

Ask the design lead for a copy of the fonts for your prototype. For Figma continue to use the GDS Transport font for now.
