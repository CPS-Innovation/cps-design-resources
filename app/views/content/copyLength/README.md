Break up copy into short sentences. One idea per sentence.

Space is at a premium with user interfaces. So put the important words first and drop any unnecessary words.

For example, if you’re writing help text there’s usually no need to say ‘This is the total cost’. Just say ‘Total cost’. If you’re writing an error message, don’t say ‘You have entered the wrong password’. Say ‘Wrong password’.

You don’t usually need the word ‘now’. For example, just say ‘apply’ rather than ‘apply now’ (unless you’re giving the user two options: apply now or apply later).
