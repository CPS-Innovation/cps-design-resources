Don’t use ‘ie’. Use ‘for example’ instead of ‘eg’.

Use simple contractions like ‘you’re’ and ‘we’ll’.

Avoid:

- should’ve, could’ve, would’ve, they’ve - these can be hard to read
- negative contractions like ‘can’t’ and ‘don’t’ - some users find them harder to read, or misread them as the opposite of what they say

Include any relevant acronyms on your GOV.UK start page for SEO purposes, but try to avoid using them inside the transaction.

And if you do use them, spell them out in full on each page. Don’t rely on people remembering them across different pages.
