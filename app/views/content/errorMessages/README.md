Error messaging needs to follow GOV.UK patterns like this [Error summary – GOV.UK Design System ](https://design-system.service.gov.uk/components/error-summary/)  

### ‘There is a problem with this service’
How it works

These pages should have:
- ‘Sorry, there is a problem with the service – service name – GOV.UK’ as the page title
- ‘Sorry, there is a problem with the service’ as the H1
- ‘Try again later.’ as a normal paragraph
- information about what has happened to their answers if they are in the middle of a transaction
- contact information, if it exists and helps meet a user need
- a link to another service, if they can use it to do what they came to do

###	 Contact information should either be:
- a link to a specific page that includes numbers and opening times
- include all numbers and opening times
Have clear and concise content and do not use:
- breadcrumbs
- jargon like 500 or bad request
- ‘We are experiencing technical difficulties’
- red text to warn people

Store previously entered information for a reasonable amount of time so users can resume a journey with re-populated information when the service becomes available again.
