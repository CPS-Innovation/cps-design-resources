Picking the right name means that users can:

- find your service more easily when they search online
- understand what your service does and easily decide whether to use it

### When to name your service
You should try to name your service by the end of the discovery phase. By this stage you should have:

- defined the problem you’re trying to solve
- learned more about the context of the task your users are trying to do

### How to name your service
Good service names:

- use the words users use
- are based on analytics and user research
- describe a task, not a technology
- do not need to change when policy or technology changes
- are verbs, not nouns e.g ‘Claim Witness Expenses’
- do not include government department or agency names
- are not brand-driven or focused on marketing
