Don’t rely on shape, size, colour or location alone to communicate information, because not all users will share that frame of reference. For example, don’t say things like:

- ‘click the green button’
- ‘use the menu on the left of the page’
- ‘find more information in the square box’

Break up long pages with headings. It’s easier to scan and read. Headings should describe the purpose of the text that follows - they shouldn’t be part of the text.

Screen reader users often read out lists of links in isolation, so make the purpose of the link clear from the link text alone. For example, ‘click here’ is not accessible link text.

Sometimes you need to shorten link text to avoid lots of duplication. If you do that, make sure links are still accessible to screen readers.
