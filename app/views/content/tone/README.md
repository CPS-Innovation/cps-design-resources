Be approachable and helpful, but not overly familiar. Remember that it’s government ‘speaking’.

Say ‘sorry’ if something serious has gone wrong - for example, the service has stopped working completely. ‘Sorry, there is a technical problem. Please try again in a few moments.’

There’s no need to say ‘sorry’ in validation error messages.

There’s usually no need to say ‘please’ or ‘please note’.

There’s usually no need to say thank you. For example, it’s fine to say ‘Application complete’ rather than ‘Thank you for your application’.

Avoid things like humorous error messages. People often use government services for serious things or when under stress.
