Forms are like a conversation between the service and the user.

If it’s the service ‘speaking’, the user is ‘you’ or ‘your’ and the service is ‘we’, ‘us’, ‘our’ and so on.

If it’s the user ‘speaking’, use ‘I’, ‘me’ or ‘my’.

This applies to all microcopy, including headings, input labels and link text.
